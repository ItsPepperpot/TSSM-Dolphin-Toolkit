# TSSM-Dolphin-Watchlist
Dolphin memory watch files for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. They label notable memory addresses which may be useful for debugging and speedrunning strat hunting/practice.

Memory locations vary depending which version of the game is used; I plan to update the repository with more versions.

Example use cases:
- Practising two-frame token warps by reading the Token Count (token counter increments when the loading screen appears after warping)
- Practising one-frame damage boosts by locking Patrick/SpongeBob's health in the memory engine.

## How to Use
1. Download [Dolphin Memory Engine](https://github.com/aldelaro5/Dolphin-memory-engine/releases)
2. Clone/download this repository.
3. In Dolphin Memory Engine, go to `File > Open` and open the correct .dmw for your game version.
4. Open the game in Dolphin.
